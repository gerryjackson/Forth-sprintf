Sprintf Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

07/01/2019 Version 1.0.2
   - Bug fixed in BAD-FP-NUMBER and NEW-RADIX-FRAME caused by use of GET-WIDTH
   - Added GET-WIDTH and GET-PREC to replace PREC and WIDTH to ensure that when
     * is used for the width and precision field values, the correct value is
     used

26/11/2018 Version 1.0.1
   - Changed README.MD so that theforth.net displayed the conversion specifiers
     etc properly at the end of the file (theforth.net can't handle <br> tags
     whereas GitHub can).

10/10/2018 Version 1.0.0
   - Initial release.
